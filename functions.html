	Via Roma can host functions in the restaurant or provide catering for functions at other venues. At the restaurant we can cater for up to 150 persons. At other venues, we can cater for up to 250 persons at a time. All food is from our restaurant menu and is prepared by our renowned chef, Guillermo Totti, and his team. The service is done by our team of genuine italian waiters, led by our head waiter, Rudolfo Giacometti. Whatever the occasion, a wedding, a christening, a birthday, a graduation, you can rest assured that the Via Roma experience will put a big smile on your face and on the faces of your guests.
